# Overview

This project is a react based application that allows users to manage their construction companies and projects. It features a user-friendly interface for tracking project progress, and managing resources. Using AWS RDS for database management, the application ensures data integrity and security.

This is deisgned for small to medium construction companies looking to streamline their operations and improve project management efficiency.

I used the existing app to transition this to a mobile app using React Native. The mobile app allows users to access their construction management tools on the go, providing flexibility and convenience. For the development of the mobile app, I utilized Expo to simplify the build and deployment process across both iOS and Android platforms.
